In particular, we will look at the XGBoost sentiment analysis model that we constructed earlier. In this case, however, we have some new data that our model doesn't seem to perform very well on. As a result, we will re-train our model and update an existing endpoint so that it uses our new model.\n",

That is, we don't necessarily need to use our model's results immediately and instead we can peform inference on a large number of samples.

As you continue to complete and execute notebooks you will eventually fill up this disk space, leading to errors which can be difficult to diagnose.

Of course, you can do this from the terminal or from the notebook hub if you would like. The cell below contains some commands to clean up the created files from within the notebook."
